\newsection{The Circuit}
The basic circuit is a sine generator composed of a counter generating a 5-bit phase and a "Sinus" block that uses a look-up table to convert the 5-bit signal into a 8-bit sinusoidal wave.
The output of those two blocks is then connected in parallel to all four operations, as shown in figure \ref{fig:02_circuit}
